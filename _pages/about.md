I am a first year PhD student at [CNRS UMR9018 - METSY](https://umr9018.cnrs.fr/), [Gustave Roussy Institute](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/institute), Universit√© Paris-Saclay. I am conducting my PhD research under the supervision of Dr. Svetlana Dokudovskaya in the Research Team [Chromatin Dynamics and Metabolism in Cancer](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/chromatindynamics-and-metabolism-cancer).

My research interests lie in the mTORC1 pathway in cancer and bioinformatics. I aim to explore the mTORC1 pathway and the DNA damage response in cancer through a combination of experimental methods and data mining.

I warmly welcome researchers with the same research interests as me to connect with me and offer guidence! My email is <xiaoxia.dlo@gmail.com>.
